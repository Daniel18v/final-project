The splash screen shown on startup is created using

TMS Software TAdvSmoothSplashScreen component

You can get a trial version here: https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/advsmoothsplashscreen.asp


==========================


If you do not have this component, you can easily remove it by editing uMain.pas like so:

removing "AdvSmoothSplashScreen" from uses list

Editing the FormCreate procedure for the main window and taking out any references to that component
(make sure you don't remove any critical lines required for proper startup)
