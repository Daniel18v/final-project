**The JSMESS project has been integrated into the upstream MAME repository at https://github.com/mamedev/mame and this repository is now defunct. Follow the instructions at http://docs.mamedev.org/initialsetup/compilingmame.html#emscripten-javascript-and-html to do an Emscripten compile with unmodified MAME source.**

JSMESS
======
JSMESS is an attempt to port [MESS](http://mess.org/) /
[MAME](http://mamedev.org/) to JavaScript using
[Emscripten](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten).

Why?
----
[Jason Scott](http://jsmess.textfiles.com/) says it best:
> The MESS program can emulate (or begin to emulate) a majority of home
> computers, and continues to be improved frequently. By porting this program
> into the standardized and cross-platform Javascript language, it will be
> possible to turn computer history and experience into the same embeddable
> object as movies, documents, and audio enjoy.

Status of JSMESS
----------------
Jason Scott's [JSMESS](http://jsmess.textfiles.com) site has demos for most working systems now.
JSMESS is now tracking the latest versions of MESS, and sound and joystick support work in many
cases.
